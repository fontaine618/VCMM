# To do

[ ] R Wrapper
  [x] Main function
  [ ] Summary
  [ ] Coefficients (use best EBIC as default)
  [ ] Predict
[x] Try on real data
  [ ] maybe transofrm for variance
[ ] For experiments
  [x] Implement a smoother for preprocessing (spfda suggets kernel, gfplvcm suggests refund::fpca.sc)
  [x] ISE0, ISE (see Zhong, 2022; centofanti, 2022)

# Back log

[ ] Local linear regression
  - should be fairly simple: just add additional covariates
[ ] Estimate RE
  - Using the weighted residuals interpretation, that could be easier
[ ] MPI in C++?

# Experiments ideas

speed of change
time sampling design
point estimates, GAMM: only report MSE, not classification
fix Locker?


estiamte without random effects
increase signal size
SPFDA compare point estimates

distribution of estiamte with fixed design
focus on point estimates

clean simulation

# DMBT1

Do some sort of heatmaps


# Competing methods

## Functional

- R/spfda (Wang, 2022) CRAN
  - RE, local sparsity, bands
  - requires regular design: need interpolation if not
- R/LocKer (Zhong, 2022+) CRAN
  - local sparsity
- R/slasso (Centofanti, 2022+) CRAN
  - local sparsity
- R/GFPLVCM (Li, 2022) Supp / https://github.com/BIG-S2/GFPLVCM/
  - local testing, asynchronous
- R/MTA (Wang, 2021) https://github.com/chanw0/MTA
  - global testing
- R/?? (Kong, 2015) Supp
  - local sparsity
- R/?? (Luo, 2017) https://cals.arizona.edu/~anling/sbg/software.htm
  - NB, local test
- R/MetaLonDA (Metwally, 2018) CRAN (error) or install_github("aametwally/MetaLonDA", ref = "master")
  - NB, local test
  - all taxa simultaneously
- R/Permuspliner (Shields-Cutler, 2018, FiM) https://github.com/RRShieldsCutler/splinectomeR
- R/mgcv: spline, no penalty, use pointwise CI
- R/gamlss
- R/lmer: spline, RI, use pointwise CI

## Cross-sectional
- R/metagenomeSeq (Paulson, 2013) Bioconductor
  - ZIG
  
# Bugs, etc.

[ ] The penalty on beta1 is hard coded for now; could be an argument later

# Notes

- The CV/AIC/BIC often show two local modes
  - one with medium h, one with large h
- "For a general basis system, a set of sparse coefficients
does not necessarily generate a function with local sparse
feature, which may make trouble in the computation. On the
contrary, B-spline basis enjoys the compact support property
(Ramsay and Silverman 2005), which means that the basis
is non-zero over no more than d + 1 adjacent subintervals." 
(Sparse logistic functional principal component analysis for binary data, Zhong et al, 2021)
- add a footnote that if asynchronous covariate, we can do preprocessing using, say FPCA
