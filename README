# To do

[x] Calculate Lipschitz constant
[x] Use Lipschitz constant to set stepsize
[x] Find smallest lambda with 0
[x] Empirical Bayes to estimated random effects
[x] Implement solution path starting at lambda max
[ ] Implement BIC for solution pas
  - BIC should be -2llk +  vlog(nh)/nh (eq. -2llk <- rss since the other term is contsant, but there be some scaling issue?)
  - Compare to EBIC
  - Can we just take the proxy matrix? Missing scale?
[ ] Experiemnt with estimation of Sigma, seems wrong for the moment (way to large?)
[ ] What are the fitted values?
  - Interpolation (this makes more sense to me)
  - Kernel weighing
[ ] choose the kernel scale
  - BIC might not be the best approach since log(nh) can get negative
  - KLasso paper requires h~n^-1/5
  - look at what the properties of log(nh)/(nh) are required? might need to restrict ot the monotonically decreasing part
  - convex for h > e^(3/2) / n
  - looks like choosing it without penalty should be very good
  - use tvReg and use the chosen value
  - use some estimator
[x] Connection to Spline, GP?
[ ] confidence band
  - Bootstrap?
  - variance estimation? Information matrix?
  - Buhlmann & ?? Bootstrap for LASSO (vary lambda, selection frequency; selection stability)
